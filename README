BusinessCard

The idea of a business card with an embedded uC was taken from:

http://t4f.org/en/projects/business-card

George Boudreau borrowed the idea (with permission) and created the hardware.  The uC is the PIC24FJ64GA002.

This repo is for firmware for the card.

Developers include Alex Lee, Loftur Jonasson, Ken McGuire and George Boudreau.
